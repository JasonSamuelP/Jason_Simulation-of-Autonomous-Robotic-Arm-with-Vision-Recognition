Repository that contains 3D Model, Source Codes, and Video Demonstration

This project focuses on developing a low cost articulated autonomous robotic arm with vision recognition. The robotic arm structure and the overall model are designed using 3D model Solidworks software. In this case, an Arduino Uno microcontroller is used in the circuit to control the servo and sensors. This system forms a sensing system where the object detection and tracking are performed. The algorithm for this sensing system is developed and tested in MATLAB software. Moreover, some of the simulation parameters for the robotic arm are set in this software. Simulink software is used to demonstrate the robotic arm motion. The main results for this project are divided into two parts. The first one is the object detection and tracking algorithm of different RGB colors where the sensing system is tested. This sensing system successfully functions in real-time. The second one is the robotic arm pick and place simulation. This simulation is successfully simulated in Simulink software and obtain the desired end-effector position. It also successfully performs trajectory planning for different robot configurations.
